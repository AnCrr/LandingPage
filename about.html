                    What is the landing page?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a special type of site optimized to 
                    induce action on the Internet user. A 
                    traditional landing page describes a product, 
                    its benefits, and indicates the need to 
                    purchase that product. In an ideal world, a 
                    landing page is created in such a way that a 
                    user who does not know anything about the 
                    product makes a purchase after visiting the 
                    site.

                    How a landing page differs from a regular 
                    website
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The main difference between a landing page 
                    and a regular multi-page site is the use of a 
                    minimum of funds to convince the maximum 
                    number of site visitors to perform a certain 
                    action. That is, when selecting and placing 
                    information, the main rule is one - 
                    information should be read on the fly. The 
                    visitor should not go to another site to find 
                    out more information, read reviews or compare 
                    prices.
